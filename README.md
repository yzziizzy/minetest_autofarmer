(WIP) minetest_autofarmer
================

by Izzy
Props to RealBadAngel, VanessaE. Lots of code "borrowed" from them.

Edit and fixes by HarrierJack, borrowing even more code..

###Introduction:
Adds automatic farming machines to minetest. They run on LV/MV/HV power from technic, and integrate with pipeworks. 

The planter will put seeds from the normal game plants (wheat etc.) and plants without seeds from farming_plus (farming redo?) onto available farmland in its front position and only at its own block level. 

A mesecon signal can be used to turn the machine off. Powering the planter is enough to activate it, providing there are seeds/plants inside it.

Values can be changed in default_settings.txt
LV-planter: 6000 EU for a 5 X 6 grid
MV-planter: 11000 EU for a 7 X 15 grid 
HV-planter: 22000 EU for a grid of choice through its interface

The Harvester will 'harvest' any plant/tree node within it's reach, settings are configurable through it's own form. The harvester only comes in MV flavor, _TODO: it just requires more the bigger the area._ Also height is a factor so it can be used for farming trees. Harvesting can also be done one block down so the harvester can be stacked on top of the planter.


####TODO: 	
	- [X] fix planter
	- [ ] do something with water/pipes? (probably not)
	- [X] fix/create harvester
	- [ ] tweak craft / default settings (feedback appreciated)
	- [ ] test/squash/enjoy
	- [ ] ohyeah, some pretty textures would be nice.. :S

###How to install:
TIP: It's usually better to rename the folder to 'autofarmer' removing the trailing 'minetest_'.

Unzip the archive an place it in minetest-base-directory/mods/minetest/
if you have a windows client or a linux run-in-place client. If you have
a linux system-wide instalation place it in ~/.minetest/mods/minetest/.
If you want to install this mod only in one world create the folder
worldmods/ in your worlddirectory.

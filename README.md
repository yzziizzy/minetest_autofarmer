(WIP) minetest_autofarmer
================

by Izzy
Props to RealBadAngel, VanessaE. Lots of code "borrowed" from them.

Edit and fixes by HarrierJack, borrowing even more code..

Introduction:
Adds automatic farming machines to minetest. They run on LV/MV/HV power from technic, and integrate with pipeworks. 

The planter will put seeds from the normal game plants (wheat etc.) and plants without seeds from farming_plus (farming redo?) onto available farmland in its front position. In case technic mod is available the higher the current level (LV/MV/HV) the bigger the farm.

(TODO optional?): standalone version not requiring moreores/mesecons/pipeworks/technic (although those mods are AWESOME and RECOMMENDED)

TODO: 	- finetune planter
	- make technic/mesecons/pipeworks optional?
	- fix/create harvester
	- tweak craft / default settings (feedback appreciated)
	- test/squash/enjoy

	- ohyeah, some pretty textures could be nice.. :S

How to install:
TIP: It's usually better to rename the folder to 'autofarmer' removing the trailing 'minetest_'.

Unzip the archive an place it in minetest-base-directory/mods/minetest/
if you have a windows client or a linux run-in-place client. If you have
a linux system-wide instalation place it in ~/.minetest/mods/minetest/.
If you want to install this mod only in one world create the folder
worldmods/ in your worlddirectory.
